# Phoenixminer-ETH-preconfigured
My version of Phoenixminer that is preconfigured, just double click the start_miner.bat and your off!
If any problems arrise, and nothing on the internet fixes it, dont hesatate to ask me!!
I reconfigured Phoenixminer to auto mine ETH and then give you an estmatated hash rate, figured people could benafit from it.
